# cs330-opengl-scene-project
This project is an OpenGL scene I created for my CS330 final project.

How do I approach designing software and developing programs? 
I start by getting a solid understanding of the project, then break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. This modular approach helps keep everything organized and ensures that each part of the code can be easily reused and adjusted. Staying organized in this way was crucial in managing the 3D scene and making sure all the elements worked seamlessly together.
What new design skills have I developed, and what design process did I follow for this project?
This project sharpened my ability to design with a modular mindset, improving how I apply realistic textures and lighting. I approached the design by first studying the 2D image I wanted to replicate or create, then breaking the project down into smaller tasks like adding camera controls, building models, adding textures, and setting up lights. This methodical approach kept me focused, made the process smoother, and ensured that the code was organized and easy to tweak or reuse.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work, and what new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The modular design tactics I focused on for textures, materials, and lighting made the project more manageable and are strategies I’ll definitely use in future work. Breaking things down into reusable components keeps everything organized and ensures that all elements work together seamlessly. Additionally, incorporating features like camera controls and user interactions and continually testing and refining each part were crucial to the success of the scene and will be valuable strategies in future projects.
 
How did iteration factor into your development, and how has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Iteration was huge in this project. I kept testing and tweaking each part of the scene, especially the textures, lighting, and camera controls. This iterative process helped me catch issues early and polish the scene to a higher standard. As I moved through the milestones, I started seeing the project more as an integrated whole rather than just a collection of tasks. I got better at predicting how changes in one area would impact the rest of the scene, which led to more strategic decisions in my coding. This shift in approach really helped me bring everything together by the end.
How can computer science, particularly computational graphics, help me reach my goals?
The skills I've gained in computational graphics are opening a lot of possibilities for both my education and career. By bridging the gap between coding and visual creation, I'm now able to create engaging 3D visuals that are useful in projects requiring advanced visualizations or simulations. This knowledge will help with deeper studies in areas like game development, VR, and simulation work, making it a major asset as I tackle more challenging projects. Whether in an academic setting or in the professional world, these skills are going to help me push boundaries and achieve my goals in computer science.
